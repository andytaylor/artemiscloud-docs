= Overview of the Operator Lifecycle Manager

In {{ClientTool} ContainerName} 4.1 and later, the __Operator Lifecycle Manager__ (OLM) helps users install, update, and generally manage the lifecycle of all Operators and their associated services running across their clusters. It is part of the Operator Framework, an open source toolkit designed to manage Kubernetes native applications (Operators) in an effective, automated, and scalable way.

The OLM runs by default in {ClientTool}  Container Platform 4.1 and later, which aids cluster administrators in installing, upgrading, and granting access to Operators running on their cluster. The {ClientTool}  Container Platform web console provides management screens for cluster administrators to install Operators, as well as grant specific projects access to use the catalog of Operators available on the cluster.

__OperatorHub__ is the graphical interface that {ClientTool}  cluster administrators use to discover, install, and upgrade Operators. With one click, these Operators can be pulled from OperatorHub, installed on the cluster, and managed by the OLM, ready for engineering teams to self-service manage the software in development, test, and production environments.

When you have deployed the Operator, you can use Custom Resource (CR) instances to create broker deployments such as standalone and clustered brokers.

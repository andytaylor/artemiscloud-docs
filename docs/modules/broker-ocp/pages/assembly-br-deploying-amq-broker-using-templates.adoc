= Deploying {BrokerName} on {OpenShiftContainerName} using application templates

[IMPORTANT]
====
Starting in 7.8, the use of application templates for deploying {BrokerName} on {OpenShiftContainerName} is a deprecated feature. This feature will be removed in a future release. Red Hat continues to support existing deployments that are based on application templates. However, Red Hat does not recommend using application templates for new deployments. For new deployments, Red Hat recommends using the {BrokerName} Operator. For information on installing and deploying the Operator, see xref:deploying-broker-on-ocp-using-operator_{context}[].
====

The procedures in this section show:

* How to install the {BrokerName} image streams and application templates
* How to prepare a template-based broker deployment
* An example of using the {OpenShiftContainerName} web console to deploy a basic broker instance using an application template. For examples of deploying other broker configurations using templates, see xref:template-based-broker-deployment-examples_{context}[template-based broker deployment examples].

== Prerequisites
* You should have read the comparison of methods for deploying {BrokerName} on {OpenShiftContainerName}. For new deployments, Red Hat recommends using the {BrokerName} Operator. For more information, see xref:assembly-br-planning-a-deployment_{context}[].

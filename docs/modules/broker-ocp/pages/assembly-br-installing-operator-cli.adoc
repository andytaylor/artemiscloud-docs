= Installing the Operator using the CLI

The procedures in this section show how to use the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI) to install and deploy the latest version of the Operator for {BrokerName} {BrokerVersion} in a given OpenShift project. In subsequent procedures, you use this Operator to deploy some broker instances.

* For an alternative method of installing the {BrokerName} Operator that uses the OperatorHub graphical interface, see xref:managing-broker-operator-using-operator-lifecycle-manager_{context}[].
* To learn about __upgrading__ existing Operator-based broker deployments, see xref:assembly_br-upgrading-operator-based-broker-deployments_{context}[].

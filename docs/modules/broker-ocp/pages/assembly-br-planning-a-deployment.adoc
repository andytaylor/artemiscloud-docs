The procedures in the next section show you how to install the Operator and use Custom Resources (CRs) to create broker deployments on OpenShift Container Platform.
When you have successfully completed the procedures, you will have the Operator running in an individual Pod. Each broker instance that you create will run as an individual Pod in a StatefulSet in the same project as the Operator. Later, you will you will see how to use a dedicated addressing CR to define addresses in your broker deployment.

= Template-based broker deployment examples

.Prerequisites
* These procedures assume an {OpenShiftContainerName} instance similar to that created in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/3.11/html-single/getting_started/[{OpenShiftContainerName} Getting Started^].
* In the {BrokerName} application templates, the values of the AMQ_USER, AMQ_PASSWORD, AMQ_CLUSTER_USER, AMQ_CLUSTER_PASSWORD, AMQ_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD, and AMQ_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD environment variables are stored in a secret. To learn more about using and modifying these environment variables when you deploy a template in any of tutorials that follow, see xref:con_br-about-sensitive-credentials_{context}[About sensitive credentials].

The following procedures example how to use application templates to create various deployments of brokers.

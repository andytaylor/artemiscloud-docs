= Connecting to {ConsoleName} for an Operator-based broker deployment

Each broker Pod in an Operator-based deployment hosts its own instance of {ConsoleName} at port 8161. To provide access to the console for each broker, you can configure the Custom Resource (CR) instance for the broker deployment to instruct the Operator to automatically create a dedicated Service and Route for each broker Pod.

The following procedures describe how to connect to {ConsoleName} for a deployed broker.

.Prerequisites
* You must have created a broker deployment using the {BrokerName} Operator. For example, to learn how to use a sample CR to create a basic broker deployment, see xref:proc_br-deploying-basic-broker-operator_{context}[].
* To instruct the Operator to automatically create a Service and Route for each broker Pod in a deployment for console access, you must set the value of the `console.expose` property to `true` in the Custom Resource (CR) instance used to create the deployment. The default value of this property is `false`. For a complete Custom Resource configuration reference, including configuration of the `console` section of the CR, see xref:ref_br-custom-resource-definition-config-reference_{context}[].
